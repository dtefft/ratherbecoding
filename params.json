These examples won't be perfect for everyone, or perhaps anyone, but I hope it is a good leaping off point when you need to create a document. All the documents in the repo will be authored in MarkDown. The reason is it will be easier to do merges and it's an open source standard.\r\n\r\nThe types of documents I plan to put in this repo will cover topics as:\r\n\r\n* Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)\r\n* Performance Reviews\r\n* Job Descriptions\r\n* Job Competencies\r\n* Examples of regulated environment documentation\r\n* etc\r\n\r\n#### Personal Note\r\nI consider myself a pretty solid developer and I have made my way to management as so many good developers do. Every time I am asked to produce some documentation around processes or personnel my heart sinks a little. I do not consider myself a good writer and in fact, I am a bit self-conscious about my abilities in that arena. Even as I write this, I feel a little anxious. My hope is that I can help other developers who might be in my situation. There are a variety of skills needed to be a good manager, and good communication is one of them. If I can help someone by giving them a leaping off point, I will be thrilled. I also hope that others who are better writers and me can contribute to making some very helpful examples of documentation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRight now I am the only contributor but I would love to get some help (@dtefft)\r\n\r\n",
