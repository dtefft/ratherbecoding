###Rather Be Coding
Repository of document examples for developers (who would rather be coding) who get turned into managers

####Goal
The purpose of this project is to have a repo in which document examples can be shared and improved upon for software development manager. These examples won't be perfect for everyone, or perhaps anyone, but I hope it is a good leaping off point when you need to create a document. All the documents in the repo will be authored in MarkDown. The reason is it will be easier to do merges and it's an open source standard.

The types of documents I plan to put in this repo will cover topics as:

* Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
* Performance Reviews
* Job Descriptions
* Job Competencies
* Examples of regulated environment documentation
* etc

####Personal Note
I consider myself a pretty solid developer and I have made my way to management as so many good developers do. Every time I am asked to produce some documentation around processes or personnel my heart sinks a little. I do not consider myself a good writer and in fact, I am a bit self-conscious about my abilities in that arena. Even as I write this, I feel a little anxious. My hope is that I can help other developers who might be in my situation. There are a variety of skills needed to be a good manager, and good communication is one of them. If I can help someone by giving them a leaping off point, I will be thrilled. I also hope that others who are better writers and me can contribute to making some very helpful examples of documentation.
