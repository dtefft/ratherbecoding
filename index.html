repository of document examples for developers (who would rather be coding) who get turned into managers</p>

<h4>
<a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h4>

<p>The purpose of this project is to have a repo in which document examples can be shared and improved upon for software development managers. These examples won't be perfect for everyone, or perhaps anyone, but I hope it is a good leaping off point when you need to create a document. All the documents in the repo will be authored in MarkDown. The reason is it will be easier to do merges and it's an open source standard.</p>

<p>The types of documents I plan to put in this repo will cover topics as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</li>
<li>Performance Reviews</li>
<li>Job Descriptions</li>
<li>Job Competencies</li>
<li>Examples of regulated environment documentation</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<a id="personal-note" class="anchor" href="#personal-note" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Note</h4>

<p>I consider myself a pretty solid developer and I have made my way to management as so many good developers do. Every time I am asked to produce some documentation around processes or personnel my heart sinks a little. I do not consider myself a good writer and in fact, I am a bit self-conscious about my abilities in that arena. Even as I write this, I feel a little anxious. My hope is that I can help other developers who might be in my situation. There are a variety of skills needed to be a good manager, and good communication is one of them. If I can help someone by giving them a leaping off point, I will be thrilled. I also hope that others who are better writers and me can contribute to making some very helpful examples of documentation.</p>
